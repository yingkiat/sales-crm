# 2026 Strategic Framework - Human-AI Acceleration Model

## Role & Context

**Role Transition:**
- FROM: Team Lead (managing traditional RM team)
- TO: Business Development Lead (individual contributor, freed from management overhead)

**Organization:**
- DBS (world's leading digital bank in Singapore)
- Innovation mandate = permission to explore cutting-edge methods
- SME Banking division

**Current Setup:**
- Solo operator (intern not yet onboarded)
- Full autonomy to experiment with new acquisition methods

---

## The Core Hypothesis

**Human judgment on top of machine-scale scanning beats traditional RM team models - and it works across multiple hunting scenarios, not just new business.**

**My Edge:**
- Business experience + sales instincts + AI orchestration skills = velocity advantage
- Can move faster and more effectively than traditional teams with AI leverage
- AI handles operational consistency (follow-ups, context tracking) → I focus on relationship depth and client stickiness
- Framework versatility - Human-AI Acceleration framework works across NTB, dormant accounts, strategic wallet growth, and product-led plays
- Technology accentuates my human strengths rather than replacing them

**What "Beating Traditional Teams" Means:**
- All of the above (doesn't matter exactly which):
  - More deals closed per quarter
  - Higher-quality pipeline (better conversion rates)
  - Faster time-to-meeting (velocity)
  - Broader market coverage (seeing opportunities others miss)
- Visual: Super fast and effective execution across multiple hunting scenarios

## Coverage Strategy: 4 Hunting Tracks

**Track 1: New-to-Bank (NTB)**
- **Target:** Companies in identified industries (logistics, tech, precision engineering, healthcare, marine)
- **Opportunity:** Greenfield acquisition - capturing wallet before competitors
- **AI Role:** Scan public signals at scale (awards, tenders, expansion announcements, hiring spikes)
- **Conversion Timeline:** Medium-long (3-9 months from first contact to onboarding)
- **Primary Challenge:** Breaking in cold, establishing credibility

**Track 2: Dormant Accounts**
- **Target:** Existing DBS customers who've gone quiet (inactive or minimal activity)
- **Opportunity:** Reactivation plays - lower barrier than cold outreach
- **AI Role:** Scan for reactivation triggers (new facilities, hiring, funding rounds, leadership changes)
- **Conversion Timeline:** Short-medium (1-4 months - relationship already exists)
- **Primary Challenge:** Understanding why they went dormant, finding the right re-engagement angle

**Track 3: Strategic Accounts (Wallet Growth)**
- **Target:** 10 accounts I brought over with strong wallet expansion potential
- **Opportunity:** Deep wallet share growth (cross-sell, upsell, share-of-wallet capture)
- **AI Role:** Monitor wallet expansion triggers (M&A, regional expansion, new business lines, capex events)
- **Conversion Timeline:** Ongoing (relationship management + opportunistic deal capture)
- **Primary Challenge:** Maintaining relationship continuity, spotting expansion moments before they tell you

**Track 4: Cash Management Focus (Product-Led)**
- **Target:** Companies with operational complexity (multi-entity, cross-border, high transaction volumes)
- **Opportunity:** Fee income stream via cash management solutions (not just lending)
- **AI Role:** Scan for cash mgmt triggers (multi-entity structures, cross-border flows, payroll complexity)
- **Conversion Timeline:** Medium (2-6 months - specific product pitch)
- **Primary Challenge:** Educating on cash mgmt value (not top-of-mind for many SMEs)

**Why 4 Tracks:**
- **Diversified pipeline:** Not dependent on any single hunting motion
- **Different conversion timelines:** Balances quick wins (dormant, strategic) with longer plays (NTB, cash mgmt)
- **Risk mitigation:** If one track stalls, others keep moving
- **Coverage breadth:** Maximizes market opportunity across new, existing, and product-led angles

## Human-AI Acceleration Framework

The Human-AI Acceleration framework has 3 parts that work **across all 4 hunting tracks** - not just for NTB. Each track leverages the framework differently based on its unique needs.

**Accelerator 1: Signal-to-Prospect Engine**
- AI scans public signals at scale (awards, tenders, hiring spikes, expansion announcements, funding rounds, leadership changes)
- I apply judgment to spot the real opportunities
- Outcome: Systematic market scanning vs. reactive referrals

**Accelerator 2: Engagement Accelerator**
- AI expedites trigger-based outreach documents (emails, call scripts, prospect packs)
- AI handles follow-up tracking and context management (meeting notes, trigger updates, next actions)
- I execute with relationship skills and human touch
- Outcome: Trigger-based personalization vs. generic cold calling, better follow-up consistency = stronger client stickiness

**Accelerator 3: Learning Loop**
- Track what converts, refine triggers, get better over time
- Data-driven iteration vs. gut feel
- Outcome: Continuous improvement in conversion intelligence across all 4 tracks

## How 4 Tracks × Human-AI Acceleration Work Together

**The Matrix:**
Each hunting track leverages the framework differently:

| **Human-AI Acceleration** | **Track 1: NTB** | **Track 2: Dormant** | **Track 3: Strategic** | **Track 4: Cash Mgmt** |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Signal Engine** | Scan markets for high-intent prospects | Scan for reactivation triggers | Monitor wallet expansion triggers | Scan for cash mgmt triggers (multi-entity ops) |
| **Engagement Accelerator** | Trigger-based outreach + prospect packs | Re-engagement outreach (personalized) | Relationship continuity + meeting prep | Targeted cash mgmt outreach (not generic lending) |
| **Learning Loop** | Refine triggers, improve NTB conversion | Learn what reactivates dormant accounts | Learn what drives wallet share growth | Learn which triggers drive CM adoption |

**Visual diagram available:** `reference/hunting_matrix.drawio`

**Key Insight:**
The Human-AI Acceleration framework adapts to different hunting contexts - **proving versatility over single-use-case tools.**

## The Trifecta (Human-AI Hybrid)

- **AI does:** Breadth + consistency (scan markets, generate outreach at scale, track follow-ups, maintain context)
- **I do:** Judgment + relationships (prioritize leads, execute meetings, close deals, deepen client stickiness)
- **Result:** Technology accentuates human strengths rather than replacing them

## KPI Framing

**What I'm Proposing:**
"KPIs around pipeline quality and conversion velocity rather than traditional activity metrics, because **I'm hunting across 4 different tracks with different conversion timelines** - a fixed monthly asset target doesn't reflect the reality of this coverage model."

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- Track 1 (NTB): 3-9 month conversion cycles → can't be measured monthly
- Track 2 (Dormant): 1-4 month cycles → quicker wins but unpredictable timing
- Track 3 (Strategic): Ongoing wallet expansion → lumpy deal flow
- Track 4 (Cash Mgmt): 2-6 month cycles + educational component → variable timing

**A fixed "bring in S$5M/month" target assumes uniform conversion timelines - which doesn't exist in this model.**

**What I'm NOT Proposing:**
- Fixed monthly asset targets (e.g., "bring in S$5M/month")
- Activity metrics (calls per day, meetings per week)
- Volume-based measures

**What I AM Proposing:**
- Pipeline quality metrics (confidence levels, trigger strength, engagement readiness)
- Conversion velocity metrics (trigger-to-meeting rate, meeting-to-deal rate)
- Trigger-to-meeting effectiveness (by track)
- Market coverage breadth (prospects identified per track)
- Learning loop improvements (e.g., "20% improvement in trigger-to-conversion by Q4")

---

## Communication Objective

**Purpose:**
Pre-frame my KPIs by explaining WHY traditional metrics don't fit this model, and give leadership a vision that makes them look innovative.

**Audience:**
- Department Head
- SME Banking Head

**Format:**
- Exec summary email (NOT a formal presentation)
- Casual but credible tone
- No specific numbers (too formal, kills the casual vibe)

**Implicit Ask:**
1. Looser KPIs (quality/velocity vs. fixed monthly targets)
2. Air cover to execute unconventionally
3. Don't judge by traditional RM activity metrics (calls per day, pipeline meetings)
4. Trust that this will make DBS look cutting-edge

**Tone:**
- Confident in my sales skills
- Practical (this is structured, not fluff or "AI magic")
- Gratitude for leeway + confidence I'll deliver results

---

## Email Structure

1. **Opening:** "As I'm setting my 2026 KPIs, wanted to give you context on my approach..."

2. **Setup:** Brief context on Biz Dev Lead role + DBS innovation mandate + opportunity to test new methods

3. **Coverage Strategy:** 4 Hunting Tracks (the WHAT - where I'm hunting)
   - New-to-Bank (NTB)
   - Dormant Accounts
   - Strategic Accounts (10 wallet growth plays)
   - Cash Management Focus (fee income)

4. **Execution Framework:** Human-AI Acceleration framework (the HOW - how AI amplifies each track)
   - Signal-to-Prospect Engine
   - Engagement Accelerator
   - Learning Loop

5. **The Integration:** How 4 tracks × Human-AI Acceleration work together (matrix/diagram reference)

6. **The Hypothesis:** Human judgment + AI scale = faster/sharper than traditional teams

7. **KPI Ask:** Quality/velocity metrics vs. fixed monthly targets (justified by 4-track model with different conversion timelines)

8. **Close:** Gratitude for leeway + confidence I'll deliver + "I'll make you look cutting-edge"

---

## Key Messaging Points

- **Coverage breadth:** 4 tracks = diversified pipeline, not single-dimensional hunting
- **Framework versatility:** Human-AI Acceleration framework works across all 4 tracks (not single-use tools)
- **DBS should be pioneering this:** Backs up their innovation positioning
- **I have the right skills:** Business experience + sales + AI orchestration
- **This is structured, not fluff:** 4-track strategy + Human-AI Acceleration framework + learning loop
- **KPIs must reflect reality:** Different tracks have different conversion timelines - fixed monthly targets don't work
- **Trust the process:** Don't micromanage with traditional metrics
- **This will make leadership look forward-thinking**

---

## What NOT to Include

- Specific numbers/targets (keeps it casual)
- Mention of intern (not onboarded yet)
- Over-explanation of technical details (they don't need to know about CSVs, triggers.csv, etc.)
- Time estimates or timelines
- Comparisons to old team's specific performance
- Deep technical explanation of how AI works (keep it high-level)

---

## Success Criteria for the Email

They should walk away thinking:
1. "He has a clear framework, not just vibes" (4 tracks + Human-AI Acceleration = structure)
2. "This could make us look innovative" (DBS pioneering Human-AI Acceleration)
3. "His KPIs make sense for this model" (4 tracks with different timelines = can't use fixed monthly targets)
4. "He's covering more ground than a traditional RM team" (NTB + dormant + strategic + product-led)
5. "Let's give him room to run" (trust the experiment)
