# Singapore SME Banking Target List: 77 Qualified Companies Across 5 Sectors

**77 companies** have been identified matching the SGD 30-100M revenue profile based on proxy indicators, with actionable intelligence for SME banking sales opportunities. These are privately-held, non-SGX-listed enterprises demonstrating growth signals and clear banking needs.

---

## Executive summary and prioritization framework

This target list focuses exclusively on companies with verifiable growth signals, award recognition, and identifiable banking needs. **E50 Award winners receive highest priority** as they undergo KPMG financial assessment confirming revenue thresholds. Companies are ranked by confidence level based on data quality and recency of growth signals.

**Highest-priority targets** share three characteristics: multiple industry awards (E50, SME 500), recent expansion announcements within 18 months, and clear capital-intensive growth plans (facility expansions, M&A activity, regional expansion). The strongest banking opportunities cluster around **trade finance** (exporters, distributors), **facility financing** (warehouse, clinic, outlet expansions), **equipment financing** (medical devices, manufacturing machinery, cold chain), and **working capital** (multi-entity operations, long project cycles).
