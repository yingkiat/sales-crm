# CRM Business Parameters

## Hunting Strategy: 4-Track Approach

**Track 1: New-to-Bank (NTB)**
- Target industries: Logistics, Tech, Precision Engineering, Healthcare, Marine
- Focus: Greenfield acquisition, capture wallet before competitors
- Products: Full suite (lending, trade finance, working capital)

**Track 2: Dormant Accounts**
- Target: Existing customers with inactive/minimal activity
- Focus: Reactivation plays, lower barrier than cold outreach
- Products: Re-engagement based on new triggers

**Track 3: Strategic Accounts (Wallet Growth)**
- Target: Existing portfolio accounts with strong wallet expansion potential
- Focus: Deep wallet share growth (cross-sell, upsell, share-of-wallet)
- Products: Opportunistic based on expansion moments

**Track 4: Cash Management Focus (Product-Led)**
- Target: Companies with operational complexity (multi-entity, cross-border, high transaction volumes)
- Focus: Fee income via cash management solutions
- Products: Cash mgmt, multi-currency accounts, FX hedging (non-credit products)

## Target Profile

**Geography:** Singapore (operating entities only)

**Company Size:**
- Revenue: S$30M - S$100M (holdco aggregated)
- Employee range: 50-500 employees (proxy indicator)
- **Note:** Size guidelines are flexible based on product opportunity (e.g., cash mgmt doesn't require size constraints)

**Target Sectors (Priority Order):**
1. Logistics, Supply Chain & Trade
2. Manufacturing & Industrial
3. Healthcare, Wellness & Life Sciences
4. F&B, Retail & Consumer
5. Technology & Professional Services

## Exclusions (Guidelines - Context-Dependent)

**These are guidelines, not hard rules. Consider the hunting track and product opportunity:**

**MNC Subsidiaries:**
- **Traditional exclusion:** Obvious MNC subsidiaries (FedEx, DHL, Siemens) for credit products
- **Exception:** MNC subsidiaries may qualify for non-credit products (cash management, FX, treasury)
- **Rationale:** Cash mgmt/FX opportunities don't require credit evaluation - product fit matters more than ownership structure
- **Example:** UMW Equipment (Sime Darby subsidiary) qualified for cash management opportunity

**Ceased Operations / Pivoting Entities:**
- **Traditional exclusion:** Companies that have closed operations
- **Exception:** Entities still ACRA-registered and pivoting to new brand/business model
- **Rationale:** Transition periods create cash mgmt needs (property holdings, restructuring, new ventures)
- **Example:** Gong Cha Singapore (ceased bubble tea ops, pivoting) qualified for property/cash mgmt opportunity

**Other Exclusions:**
- Government agencies / Statutory boards (applies to all tracks)
- Holdco revenue obviously >S$100M (flexible for Track 4 - cash mgmt)

**Note on Existing Banking Relationships:**
- Existing customers are NOT excluded - they're explicitly targeted in Track 2 (Dormant) and Track 3 (Strategic)
- Even for Track 1 (NTB), a partial banking relationship doesn't exclude wallet expansion opportunities

## Priority Scoring Criteria

**High Priority:**
- New to bank (no existing banking relationship)
- Company size close to S$40-100M revenue range

**Low Priority:**
- Media companies

**Note:** Skills do NOT auto-calculate priority. User assigns priority based on these criteria during data entry.

## Trigger Preferences (Reference)

**High-Value Triggers:**
- Expansion (facilities, regional, new outlets)
- Capex (equipment, fleet, machinery)
- Contract wins (tenders, project awards)
- M&A activity (acquisitions, mergers)

**Medium-Value Triggers:**
- Hiring spikes (team expansion)
- Compliance/regulation needs
- Operational complexity (multi-entity, cross-border)

**Low-Value Triggers:**
- General news mentions
- Social media activity

**Note:** This is for user reference. Skills capture triggers but don't assign strength ratings automatically.

## Current Banker Identification

**IMPORTANT: Extract company's existing banking relationships from news**

When researching companies, actively search for mentions of their current banker:

**Search patterns:**
- "[company name] facility [bank name]"
- "[company name] financing [bank name]"
- "[company name] loan [bank name]"
- "[company name] banking partner"
- "[company name] trade finance"

**Look for indicators in news articles:**
- "Secured S$XXM facility from [Bank Name]"
- "Partnership with [Bank Name] for trade finance"
- "Refinanced with [Bank Name]"
- "Syndicated loan led by [Bank Name]"
- "[Bank Name] provided working capital"

**Common Singapore banks to watch for:**
- OCBC, UOB, Standard Chartered, HSBC, Maybank, CIMB, ANZ, Citibank

**Record in companies.csv:**
- If banker mentioned in news → record in appropriate field
- If no banker mentioned → leave blank (not "unknown")
- If multiple banks mentioned → record primary/main banker only

**Strategic value:**
- Knowing current banker helps determine Track assignment
- No banking relationship mentioned = likely Track 1 (NTB) candidate
- Competitor bank mentioned = opportunity for wallet capture
- Existing relationship = Track 2 or Track 3 play

## Banking Products Focus

**Primary Products:**
- Trade finance
- Facility financing
- Equipment financing
- Working capital
- Regional expansion loans

**Secondary Products:**
- FX hedging
- Multi-currency accounts
- Cash management
- Project financing

**Products to Mention in Outreach:** 3 (default)

## Outreach Preferences

**Tone:** Professional but relationship-focused (Singapore business culture)

**Email Length:** 150-200 words

**Call-to-Action:** Low commitment (15-20 min intro call)

**Key Message:** Understanding SME growth challenges, providing tailored banking solutions

**Recipient Name:** Use actual name if available, generic fallback ("Dear CEO") if not
