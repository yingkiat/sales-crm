   - Multi-location working capital visibility

2. **Property Refinancing for Related Opportunities**
   - Gong Cha entity still ACRA-registered (S$2.625M paid-up capital)
   - Potential property holdings or lease deposits

## Track Performance Analysis

### Track 1 (NTB) - 3 Companies Engaged
- **Prospaq Group:** Active follow-up (existing UOB relationship - wallet share play)
- **Security & Risk Solutions:** Active follow-up (true NTB, strong expansion triggers)
- **Anderco:** Active follow-up (existing UOB relationship, govt projects)

**Insights:**
- 2 out of 3 have existing bankers (UOB) - these are wallet share opportunities, not pure NTB
- Security & Risk Solutions is the only true NTB prospect with no disclosed existing banker
- All 3 companies are in manufacturing/logistics/technology sectors (target sectors)

### Track 4 (Cash Management) - 2 Companies Engaged
- **UMW Equipment:** Rejected (lost on FX pricing to Maybank)
- **Gong Cha Singapore:** Qualified (cash mgmt + property refinancing opportunities identified)

**Insights:**
- 50% success rate (1 qualified, 1 rejected)
- Track 4 demonstrates non-credit product viability (Gong Cha opportunity is cash mgmt focused)
- Even non-credit products face pricing competition (UMW FX loss)
- Multi-entity complexity creates strong Track 4 fit (Gong Cha's dual-entity structure)

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Dormant Reactivations = High Velocity
All 5 companies engaged were dormant account reactivations, not cold NTB outreach. This validates **Track 2 (Dormant)** as a high-velocity hunting ground with lower barriers than cold prospecting.

### 2. Existing Banker ≠ Exclusion
4 out of 5 companies have existing primary bankers:
- Prospaq Group: UOB
- UMW Equipment: Maybank
- Anderco: UOB
- Gong Cha: Unknown (likely minimal banking given ceased ops/restructuring)

This reinforces that **wallet share opportunities are valid targets** across all tracks, not just Track 3 (Strategic).

### 3. Track 4 (Cash Management) Has Clear Product-Market Fit
Gong Cha Singapore demonstrates that **operational complexity creates non-credit banking needs:**
- Multi-entity operations
- Payroll for 20+ staff
- 6 retail outlets (collections, working capital visibility)
- Property/restructuring complexity

This validates Track 4 as a **fee income focus area** with opportunities that don't require credit evaluation.

### 4. Trigger Strength Matters
Security & Risk Solutions (E50 2023 winner, 12-country expansion) shows strongest engagement potential. Triggers like awards, regional expansion, and hiring correlate with banking needs readiness.

### 5. Speed of Execution
6 weeks, 5 companies engaged = **velocity advantage demonstrated**. Traditional RM approach would likely engage 1-2 companies in same timeframe via referrals.

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Next 7 Days)
1. **Prospaq Group:** Follow up Jan 7 (TODAY)
2. **Anderco:** Follow up Jan 12
3. **Gong Cha Singapore:** Complete cash management proposal

### Near-term (Next 14 Days)
4. **Security & Risk Solutions:** Follow up Jan 15 when promoter returns

### Pipeline Development
5. Continue scanning for Track 2 (Dormant) opportunities - highest velocity demonstrated
6. Refine Track 4 targeting criteria based on Gong Cha success (multi-entity operations, restructuring scenarios)

---

## Recommendations

### For Leadership Discussion

1. **Reframe Track 1 (NTB):**
   - Current reality: Most "NTB" prospects have existing bankers
   - Opportunity: Wallet share capture, not pure new-to-bank
   - Implication: Competition is for share-of-wallet, not account opening

2. **Double Down on Track 2 (Dormant):**
   - All 5 engagements were dormant reactivations
   - Lower barrier than cold NTB outreach
   - Faster conversion timelines (existing relationship foundation)

3. **Track 4 Product Development:**
   - Gong Cha demonstrates clear cash management product-market fit
   - Non-credit opportunities still face pricing pressure (UMW FX loss)
   - Need competitive FX pricing to win Track 4 deals

4. **KPI Calibration:**
   - Engagement velocity: 5 companies in 6 weeks = sustainable
   - Qualification rate: 20% (1 out of 5) = baseline established
   - Track-specific conversion timelines validated (Track 4 faster than Track 1)
