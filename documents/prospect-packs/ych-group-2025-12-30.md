**Subject:** Supporting YCH Group's Regional Expansion - Facility Financing

Dear Dr. Yap,

I've been following YCH Group's impressive regional expansion, particularly your RM500M investment in Malaysia and US$200M Vietnam hub groundbreaking announced in November 2025, along with the new YCH DistriPark Tuas opening.

Given the scale of your facility development across APAC, I thought it would be valuable to explore how DBS can support your next phase of growth with:

• **Facility financing** - Structured solutions for large-scale warehouse and distribution center development across Malaysia and Vietnam
• **Regional expansion loans** - Flexible financing tailored to your multi-country expansion strategy, with dedicated support for your RM500M Malaysia and US$200M Vietnam projects
• **Multi-currency treasury management** - Optimize cash management across SGD/MYR/VND operations and streamline cross-border flows

Would you have 20 minutes in the coming week for a brief conversation about supporting YCH's continued regional expansion?

Best regards,
[Your name]
DBS SME Banking
