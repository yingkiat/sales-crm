**Subject:** Supporting Hiap Tong's Facility Expansion - Facility Financing

Dear CEO,

I've been following Hiap Tong's strategic growth initiatives, particularly your upcoming redevelopment of the 22 Soon Lee Road facility commencing in H2 2025, along with your regional expansion into Malaysia and Indonesia markets. With your 20-year JTC lease renewal secured through 2028 and ongoing ExxonMobil contract, it's clear you're positioning for significant growth.

Given the scale of your facility redevelopment and regional expansion, I thought it would be valuable to explore how DBS can support your next phase of growth with:

• Facility financing - Structured solutions for your 22 Soon Lee Road redevelopment and future facility investments
• Regional expansion loans - Flexible financing tailored to your Malaysia and Indonesia market entry strategy
• Multi-currency treasury management - Optimize cash management across your SGD/MYR/IDR operations in multiple countries

Would you have 20 minutes in the coming week for a brief conversation about supporting Hiap Tong's facility expansion and regional growth?

Best regards,
[Your name]
