## Email Draft

**Subject:** Supporting Zhao Yang's Major MRT Project Portfolio - Project Financing

Dear CEO,

I've been following Zhao Yang Geotechnic's impressive track record on Singapore's infrastructure projects, particularly your involvement in three major MRT lines: the Cross Island Line Phase 1 (by 2029), the Cross Island Line Punggol Extension (by 2031), and the Jurong Region Line (by 2026). These multi-year government contracts represent significant opportunities and operational complexity.

Given the scale and timeline of these infrastructure projects, I thought it would be valuable to explore how DBS can support your continued growth with:

• **Project financing** - Structured long-term financing solutions tailored to multi-year government contracts with phased drawdowns aligned to project milestones
• **Performance guarantees & bonds** - Support for tender and contract performance bonds required for major infrastructure projects
• **Equipment financing** - Flexible financing for specialized geotechnical equipment to support your expanding project portfolio

With 400+ employees across 5 entities in Singapore and Malaysia, your multi-entity operations also present opportunities for streamlined cash management and cross-border treasury solutions.

Would you have 20 minutes in the coming week for a brief conversation about supporting Zhao Yang's infrastructure project portfolio?

Best regards,
[Your name]
DBS SME Banking
